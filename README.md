## 📍 Introduction

This project is a deep dive into core principles of:
- **Physics-based simulation**
- **Neural network intelligence**
- **Canvas-based rendering**

It started as an experiment and evolved into a full-fledged system where a virtual car can learn to **navigate**, **avoid obstacles**, and **drive itself** — all in real time.

> 🚀 *Learning AI by building, not just reading!*

## 🧠 Features

✅ **Car Mechanics** – Acceleration, braking, and steering dynamics  
✅ **Environment Design** – Custom roads, lane markings, and obstacles  
✅ **Sensor System** – Ray-based simulation mimicking real-world LIDAR  
✅ **Neural Network** – Fully self-trained decision-making brain  
✅ **Collision Detection** – Realistic boundary and object responses  
✅ **Persistence** – Save & load the best performing AI models
